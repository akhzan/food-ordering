## Assets

This folder is used for storing asset files like images and styles

#### Images

Please register your image files in **indexx.ts** file. The page/component that will be using the image file must import from **assets/images/index.ts**.

#### Styles

This project is using CSS framework [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as main css resources. Please refer to the [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for better understanding in tailwind usages. The folder contains 4 files.

1. custom.css -- it stores custom styles that can't be achieved with tailwindcss.
2. index.css -- it stores tailwindcss config.
3. override.css -- it stores custom styles to override antd styles.
4. tailwind.css -- generated by tailwindcss
